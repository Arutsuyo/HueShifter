HueShifter - March 15
Narayan Emery, Andrea Nosler

It is the final day, and it is done.

After a lot of trial and error, the library is handling our conversions right.
Nara created a ton of infrastructure, and basically organized the whole project.
I created some images for bars and pointer graphics for color sliding. The colors
are finally finally FINALLY shifting properly, as there was a lot of difficulty
trying to get it to scale the proper values. Lots of overflowing. But now, we have
a fast program that can shift hues of an image and dump them to a new image.

Nara has been waiting for like two hours for Ubuntu to install so that we can
finally get it working on Unix.
